            <h1> What We Exercise   </h1>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">Child hood obesity is a serious problem in the United States. According to the CDC, there are over 13.7 million children and adolescents effected by obesity. Here at STEAME Logic,
                <br> we believe that a healthy body, constitutes a healthy mind. According to the CDC, in America, Obesity is 3.9% among 2- to 5-year-olds, 18.4% among 6- to 11-year-olds, and 20.6% among
                <br> 12- to 19-year-olds. In South Carolina, in youth under the age of 18, 15% are overweight and 16.7% are obese. In order to decrease these numbers, we are developing a program that will
                <br>combine the STEAM learning aspect to Exercise, which will provide our youth an overall healthy development. </p>
